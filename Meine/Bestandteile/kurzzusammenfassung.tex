\noindent
In this paper we will look at the various tools that were used to develop a tool for the graphical representation of software projects, in the context of a web application. The beginning will be a quick introduction to the topic, also talk about the purpose of this project and show the application built. The second chapter will go from the backend to the frontend and take a closer look at each of the tools. The third chapter will focus on the technologies used to make the application publicly available through a public domain. The fourth chapter is about the actual development, as in why the before discussed technologies were chosen, lessons learned during the process and problems faced together with solutions. After this, there will be a short chapter about if, looking back, the chosen technologies where a good decision and why they might not have been. The paper will end with a list of suggestions on what could be added to/improved in the application in further development together with a short documentation.
