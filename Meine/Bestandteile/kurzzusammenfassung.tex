\noindent
This paper will look at the various systems that were used to develop a tool for the graphical representation of software projects, in the context of a web application. The beginning will give a short introduction to the topic, the purpose of this project and show the resulting application. The second chapter will go from the backend to the frontend and take a closer look at each of the tools and subsystems involved. The third chapter will focus on the technologies used to make the application publicly available through a public domain. The fourth chapter is about the actual development, as in why the technologies presented in chapter 3 were chosen, lessons learned during the process and problems faced together with solutions. After this, there will be a short chapter discussing if the chosen technologies were a good decision in retrospect and why they might not have been. The paper will end with a list of suggestions on what could be added to/improved in the application in further development together with a short documentation.
