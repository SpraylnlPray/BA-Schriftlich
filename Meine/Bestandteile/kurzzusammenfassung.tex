\noindent
In this paper we will look at the various tools that were used to develop a tool as mentioned above, in the context of a web application. To begin with, we will give a quick introduction to the topic and also talk about the purpose of this project. In the second chapter we will go from the backend to the frontend and take a closer look at each of the tools. The third chapter will focus on the technologies used to make the application publicly available through a public domain. The fourth chapter will talk about the actual development, as in why the before discussed technologies were chosen, lessons learned during the process and problems faced together with their solutions. After this, there will be a short chapter about if, looking back, the chosen technologies where a good decision and why they might not have been. The paper will end with a documentation of the codebase, together with a list of suggestions on what could be added to/improved in the application in further development.
